Predictive Modeling with Regression and Classification Algorithms

##  Project Overview

This project applies both regression and classification techniques to two different real-world-style datasets: one related to **house prices**, and the other to **heart disease risk**. The goal was to develop models, compare their performance, and identify the most suitable algorithm for each problem.

Using Python and `scikit-learn`, I implemented and evaluated **Linear Regression**, **Decision Trees**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** ‚Äî covering both regression and classification use cases.

##  Objectives

- Compare regression and classification methods on different data problems  
- Analyze how feature selection and preprocessing affect model performance  
- Understand how dataset type influences algorithm suitability  
- Improve evaluation skills using R¬≤, accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix

##  Datasets Used

###  **Regression Dataset ‚Äì House Prices**
- Source: King County housing dataset
- Target: Sale price
- Features: Bathrooms, sqft_living, year_built, etc.

### ‚ù§ **Classification Dataset ‚Äì Heart Attack Risk**
- Synthetic health dataset mimicking clinical features
- Target: Heart attack risk (0 = low, 1 = high)
- Features: Age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.

##  What I Learned

- The importance of matching algorithms to data structure  
- How to evaluate models beyond just accuracy (F1, R¬≤, confusion matrix)  
- That real-world data often requires experimentation with multiple algorithms
